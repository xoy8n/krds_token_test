      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a new page within an existing framework, integrating pre-built layout and common components, using a UI library (ShadCN) for basic structure, and creating simple mock data. It requires understanding the project's architecture and component library but doesn't involve complex logic or detailed, pixel-perfect implementation yet. The complexity is moderate due to the integration and setup steps."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing the detailed search results UI and ensuring responsiveness. Focus on subtasks for implementing specific UI sections/components based on the Figma design, handling responsiveness for different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS, potentially creating custom components, and integrating mock data into the detailed structure.",
      "reasoning": "This task is significantly more complex than the initial setup. It requires implementing detailed UI elements based on a specific design node, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy, and critically, implementing full responsiveness across multiple breakpoints. This involves careful use of CSS utilities (Tailwind), potentially creating new custom components, and thorough testing on different screen sizes. Responsiveness adds substantial complexity compared to a static layout."
